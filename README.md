# RISC-V CLIC
RISC-V Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) is an interrupt controller for
RISC-V cores subsuming the original RISC-V local interrupt scheme (CLINT). It
promises pre-emptive, low-latency, vectored, priority/level based interrupts.

This IP is meant to be used together with a suitably modified version of a core.
Currently, a modified version of the
[CV32E40P](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p) is supported.

[Here](./doc/clic.adoc) is the detailed specification this IP is based on. For
the upstream specification visit
[this](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-fast-interrupt/blob/master/clic.adoc)
link.

Note that this IP is based on an intermediate development version of the CLIC
specification which will still change substantially. This IP will try to track
the changes of the specification. The [specification document](./doc/clic.adoc)
in this repository is a snapshot of the upstream specification and the version
this IP is based on.

## Features

- RISC-V Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) compliant interrupt controller
- Support up to 4096 interrupt lines
- Support up to 8 bits of priority/level information per interrupt line
- Supports (a modified) [CV32E40P](#CLIC-and-CV32E40P)

## Parametrization
Some parameters are configurable. See the marked variables in the table below.

## Integration and Dependencies
This IP requires

- [common_cells](https://github.com/pulp-platform/common_cells)
- [register_interface](https://github.com/pulp-platform/register_interface)

and a suitably modified core (see sections below).

The [bender](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender) and legacy
[IPApproX](https://github.com/pulp-platform/IPApproX) flow are supported.

Besides the native
[register_interface](https://github.com/pulp-platform/register_interface) there
is an APB wrapper available.


## CLIC and CV32E40P
The patch required to use the CV32E40P together with the CLIC lives in this
[branch](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cv32e40p/tree/clic). The CLIC mode is
an elaboration time parameter at this moment, but will support a dynamic switch
at some point.

Here is the summary
```
Name             Value
CLICANDBASIC     0   (dynamic mode under development)
CLICPRIVMODES    2
NUM_INTERRUPT    32-256
CLICINTCTLBITS   0-8
CLICSELHVEC      1
CLICMTVECALIGN   8
CLICXNXTI        0   (partial, under development)
CLICXCSW         1
```

## CLIC and CVA6
Not supported yet.

## FreeRTOS Support
There is very basic support for the CLIC in
[pulp-freertos](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-freertos) with more a more
complete level/priority implementation in the works.

## Register interface
By default the CLIC's register file is manually written requiring no attention
of the user.

Alternatively, [regtool](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/rm/register_tool/) can
be used to generate the register file. For that, go to `src/gen/` and call `make
all` with the environment variable `REGTOOL` pointing to `regtool.py` of the
[register_interface](https://github.com/pulp-platform/register_interface)
repository and `NUM_INTERRUPT` and `CLICINTCTLBITS` appropriately set. These
three environment variables can be passed when using make, e.g. 

```console
    make NUM_INTERRUPT=128 CLICINTCTLBITS=4
```

Finally, make sure your `src_files.yml` or `Bender.yml` points to

- `src/gen/clic_reg_pkg.sv`
- `src/gen/clic_reg_top.sv`
- `src/gen/clic_reg_adapater.sv`

`regtool` has various limitations on how the register map can look like,
requiring the memory map description (`src/gen/clic.hjson`) to be derived from a
template (`src/gen/clic.hjson.tpl`), resulting in rather unwieldy code and
documentation.
